# OMOQO Challenge

## Task

Create a simple application that illustrates your skills. The application will allow the user to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update & Delete) operations on a ship. Each ship must have a name (string), length (in meters), width (in meters), and code (a string with a format of AAAA-1111-A1 where A is any character from the Latin alphabet and 1 is a number from 0 to 9).

The deliverable must be in a public GitHub repository. You can assume that reviewers will have Visual Studio Code and Docker installed. You must create a readme that contains all instructions required to run your application. No infrastructural requirements are permitted â€“ your solution must run locally. We would suggest that you mock the database (memory or file is fine).
